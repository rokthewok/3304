invoke the executable by typing:
	./project_one < input.txt > output.txt

results can be viewed in the file "output.txt"

As tested on both Ubuntu, Fedora, and CentOS with both gcc 4.7.2 and gcc 4.3.x (CentOS),
the program works. However, on Fedora, the static binary did not execute. The binary
provided should execute on the rlogin servers, though. Recompilation will ensure the
program will work on any of the above machines. Recompile by simply typing:

make clean
make
